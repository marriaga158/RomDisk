# RomDisk

A project that takes .7z and .zip files and extracts them to a temporary RAM drive. Useful if (like me) you have a collection of compressed roms on an external drive and you don't want to have both zipped and unzipped versions taking up space.

### Release Notes

Full release coming, need to add a lot more polish and maybe a basic UI

### Usage

Run the program as an administrator and select the archive you want to extract. Follow the instructions, then add the newly created Z:/ drive to the ROMs path in your emulator.
